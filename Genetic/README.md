# Travelling-Salesman-Problem

## 1. How to run the program

    a. To execute the program through MAKE file

        Build : make build
        Run   : make run

    b. To execute the program through shell script

        bash run.sh

## 2. TODO. .!

### 1. Analysis the better algorithm for large input :

    Tried to implement the ACO algo to solve the problme but not able to get the expected output and performance.
    Still looking for better approach :
        1. ACO - with better improve
        2. ABO - African buffalo optimization looks promising in terms of time complexity and cost
        3. SA

### 2.Comparion Report :

    TSPLIB data comparion report for final implementation

### 3.Implement the Parallel computing to improve the performance
